# Task description for Blue and Red ribbons

There is a straight line that goes from left to right and a bunch 
of color patches on this line.
Each patch has the coordinates of its left and right points. On the bottom
of the heap lies one red patch. On top of it lie several blue patches.
You need to write a program that determines whether some part of red
ribbon is visible from the top. Input for the program is the coordinates
of the red patch and coordinates of the blue patches.
